# A-simple-CNN-model-to-detect-circles-triangles-and-rectangles-using-Tensorflow

There are three different shapes in Folder Shape: circle, triangle and rectangle. Using this dataset, we trained the neural network to recognize these problems. At the end, we have reported the test output for 20 different photos along with the graph of the learning process of the network.
